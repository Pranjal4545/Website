        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Computer is an electronic device derived from the Latin word "computere," which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as input through input devices, processes it according to the user's requirements, stores it before and after processing, and produces meaningful information as output through output devices. Generally, a computer works on the IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle and follows the GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) principle, meaning the output is always based on the input supplied by the user. The basic operation of a computer is illustrated by the following block diagram.</p>
